Design Process
WaterTrac is for everyone especially people who are normally dehydrated for not drinking enough throughout your day. With this app, they are able to ensure they are drinking enough water during the period they wish to achieve.

As a WaterTrac user, I want to be able to input the type and amount of water so that I can keep track of my hydration levels to ensure I remain feeling hydrated and healthy throughout the day. With a history list, I will be able to look back on the days that I did not meet the requirements and consider a better study-work-life routine to ensure I meet the goal I meant to achieve by using this app.
